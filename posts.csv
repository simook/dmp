5,null,"Low Sec Survival Guide","<b>Low sec has a bad reputation...</b>&nbsp;<br><br>This mainly comes from pilots
jumping into a gate camp and find themselves facing&nbsp;a SeBoed interceptor with near instant lock time right before being summarily dispatched by twelve of his closest friends in battle
cruisers. Really, what’s not to love? It can feel like the worst of 0.0 with
none of the benefits. Yet many pilots spend most of their time in low with no
worries, and so can you. Let me start off by saying a few good things about low
sec:<br><ul><li>Unlike 0.0 there is still plenty of small
gang/1v1 pvp to be had</li><li>The rats, rocks, PI, and loot drops are
infinitely better than empire</li><li>Low sec exploration is actually worthwhile</li><li>POS possibilities even without standings</li><li>Very short waiting time for public lab slots</li></ul><i>A word about pirates...</i>

<br>In empire, the term pirate has a pretty clear meaning. In
low and 0.0, things get muddled fast. Many corps are NBSI (not blue shoot it)
partially to keep people out of their territory, some are just hoping for a
good fight, and many are just think it is easier to shoot first and ask
questions later. After all, how do they know you aren’t a pirate or scouting
for one? There are some dedicated gate campers/belt stalkers out there that are
clear-cut pirates, but if you have to get pinched by someone, at least these
guys will generally offer a ransom and will almost always honor it. If they
don’t let a director know right away and send the kill mail and local chat
transcripts via evemail.

&nbsp;

<br><br><i>Getting in Fights</i> <br>

Don’t fly what you can’t afford to lose. It doesn’t matter if
you’re a strict industrialist or a pvper, it will happen you eventually. Regardless
if you win or lose, always say “Good Fight” and be friendly. If they did
something well, let them know. If you lost, they may give you some pointers,
warn you of nearby camps, or even help give you local intel in the future if
you stay in touch. If you won, all of this goes double. Believe it or not, it
can be a good way to make friends, so keep your cool after a fight. If they are
being obnoxious, just ignore.

&nbsp;

<br><br><i>Traveling</i>

<br>First things first: make sure your overview settings are
fixed (see Read Me First). Second, check the in game maps for ships/pods
destroyed in the last hour. Well organized gate camps like the one described
at the start of the article&nbsp;are actually pretty rare, but they light right up on the map&nbsp;as the tend to catch
everyone who comes through. When in doubt, run an alt through first to check
things out. Use D-scan to make sure they aren't stalking you off grid.&nbsp;The ship you are fly makes a big difference. Shuttles and
covert ships are nearly impossible to catch. Industrials and barges can be
caught by a pirate on a coffee break. However, you can still avoid small camps
using the micro-warp drive/cloaking technique. This is done by aligning to your
destination, then quickly activating your MWD followed by your cloaking device.
When the MWD times out, decloak and you should be able to instantly warp off.
Practice this is empire first.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><i>Mining</i>

<br>Don’t mine. You will die horribly and no one will feel
sorry for you. If you must try low sec mining, mine grav sites. Many of these
will have ABC ores but the main advantage is that they must be scanned down.
Keep in mind they last a long time, so some pirates may already know the
location. Don’t use expensive ships and do consider recruiting an ewar pilot &nbsp;and/or scout in case things get ugly. Never,
ever belt mine in low.

&nbsp;

<br><br><i>General Tips for Any Low Seq Excursion Near HQ</i>

<br><ul><li>Keep close tabs on local</li><li>Keep D-scan open</li><li>

Always have a plan on how to get safe</li><li>

Use instant warp undocks for leaving stations</li><li>

The faction warfare systems surrounding Old Man Star can have
large, well organized camps. Use scouts.</li><li>Parts is often camped by solo pirates so plan accordingly.

6,null,"Special Projects","<b>Special projects can be proposed by anyone. </b><br>The idea is to
pool resources together for large projects. All you need is a detailed plan of
materials, expenses, and projected profits. Present it to one of the senior
members for approval and you are good to go.

&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br><b>So how does this work?
</b>
&nbsp;

<br>Materials contributed by members are valued at current Jita
sell orders. If you were able to get it for less, good for you, more profit!

Reimbursements for materials will be made as soon as there
is sufficient income from the project to cover expenses. If the project looses
money the loss is spread proportionally to to total isk contribution of each
participant.&nbsp;Profit after expenses is divided in the following way: 10% to D-M-P to help cover expenses, 10% to the&nbsp;organizer/BPO holder(s) in recognition of&nbsp;their&nbsp;efforts, and&nbsp;80% split
proportionally to the total isk contributions of each participant

Real time updates (for participants only) must be made
available via mailing lists or evemail by the organizer.

&nbsp;

<br><br><i>Example: A miner contributes enough trit to a project make
up 10% of the total material cost. In addition to getting Jita sell price for
the Trit, the miner can expect to see and additional 8% of the final profit.
</i>
&nbsp;

<br><br><b>Why Participate</b>

<br>If you were going to mine or do PI anyway and don’t need
the money right away, this can increase your total profit. For BPO holders it
can be pretty hard to run the logistics of keeping all your manufacture slots
in use all the time. Using special projects can help you maximize your profit
potential by maxing out your production capabilities.

&nbsp;

<br><br><b>What sort of projects qualify?<br></b><ul><li>Want to build a dreadnaught, POS towers, or a fleet of T2
barges? <i>Yup, that counts.</i></li><li>
Think you can make a killing by buying out all the iterons
in essence and reposting them at a higher price? <i>That works too.</i></li><li>

cover the basics of the big three: Mining, PI, and PvE with manufacturing and

specialized skills, there is no need to restrict yourself to just one and some
even fit together nicely.<br><br></span>
















<b>PvE</b>
<br><span>This comes in many forms. Incursions and worm hole
exploration being the two most profitable, at least at the highest levels of each. Like everything else, they require
the most skills. If there is enough interest, WH and incursion fleets can be
organized in corp. Empire based missions are probably the least profitable but
you get the added bonus of standings. Having high standings lowers a number of
fees, but most of all will give you access to jump clones. D-M-P has its best
standings with Fed Intel (Lvl4 agent located in Cat), which should give many
players instant access to high level agents. If you are running missions and
don’t plan on looting/salvaging see if any corp members might like the
opportunity. Likewise, some mission sites have great belts for miners. Make
sure to let them know. Low sec exploration can be a great source of PvE
income due to officer spawns which have &nbsp;faction/deadspace loot worth much more than
your ship. They tend to spawn lots of battle ships and warp scrambling frigates, not unlike a Lvl4 empire mission so be prepared.&nbsp;The profession-based sites (Magnetometric/Radar) can have a
significant amount of loot as well. <i>Special note to low sec site runners: </i>Move
away from the warp in spot to make sure you can get out in time should the site
be visited by less than friendly locals. If you see and Arazu or Lachesis on
scan, run. These are stealthy recons that&nbsp;can point you at nearly 60km and are always scouts for a
larger trailing force.&nbsp;</span><br><br>
















<b>Mining</b>
<br>Mining is very SP intensive, works best in groups, and has
solid, guaranteed income. Instead of going through all the details which have
been well documented elsewhere, I would like to make a few broad points:&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><ul><li><b>The Mack is </b><i><b>NOT</b></i><b> the new Hulk:</b>&nbsp;This is a common misconception. If you are a part of mining
op or working in a secure area such as a mission / grav site where you can jet
can mine in peace, the Hulk will outshine the other exhumers in every way. The
Mackinaw or Skiff are best put to use when doing something with high volume
that is semi AFK (ice mining) or if there is a serious worry of being gangked
(belt mining). In these cases, use Macks and Skiffs and 95% of gankers will
move on to another target.

&nbsp;</li><li><b>Ice Mining:</b>

Ice mining has the lowest of all returns, so why do people
do it? You do not need to worry about an asteroid being depleted so you can be
AFK for long periods with no penalty. That’s pretty much the only reason, but a
relatively persuasive one for many. Even during the Goon Galente Ice
Interdiction, high sec ice mining was no more profitable than belt mining. There
is an ice field in Deninard (through Kemerk if you are coming from arrant) and
one in Atlulle in low. Keep in mind that the first place I would look as a low
sec pirate is the one ice field in system so plan accordingly and don’t bring
T2.

&nbsp;</li><li><b>Gravimeteric Sites and Missions:</b>&nbsp;There are lots of asteroids in missions. Team up with a
mission runner and go to town. A ganker will need to scan you down in order to
find you, something most can not or will not do. Same goes for grav sites. Once
there, move away from the warp in point. If a ganker does warp in, you should
be far enough away to warp out with ease. If you plan on mining in low, only
mine in complexes and grav sites. Belt mine only if you have a scout in the
next system to warn you if someone is heading your way. Finally there are
mining missions that give out healthy rewards just like PVE missions.</li><li><b>Orca boosts, haulers, etc.</b>&nbsp;As I mentioned earlier, mining works great solo, but really starts to shine if done in large groups. At this time we have no set policy of&nbsp;reimbursement&nbsp;of dedicated haulers or Orca boosters so make sure to coordinate with&nbsp;each other&nbsp;in advance to make sure everyone is on the same page. If you see blues mining, be&nbsp;friendly&nbsp;and invite them to join.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>
















<b>Planetary Interaction</b>

<br>PI can run from being a small side source of isk to being a
major earner. A couple of basic rules apply:

<br><ul><li>Never export P0. Costs too much and is too much of a pain to
move</li><li>

Low sec, especially .3 and lower has better planets.&nbsp;&nbsp;</li><li>In low sec space, PI taxes are set by the corp owning the
player owned customs office (POCO). If many people are using low sec planets
with pocos from the same corp, let us know and we can try to negotiate a better
tax rate.</li><li>

Manufacturing only planets (P1-&gt;P3/P4) are likely to be
the most profitable but involve a lot of logistics.</li><li> When
planning your setup, make sure to think through how much time you want to spend
tending to it vs. potential profit. PI can be a full time job or something you
check in on once every few days.&nbsp;</li></ul><br>","5","2012-12-05 04:17:17.505636","2012-12-05 05:59:26.79205"

If you want to make money outside of null and can’t fly cap
ships in C6 wormholes, this is where its at. Manufacturing and investments tend
to be percentage based returns and the logistics of building 10, 100, or 1000 units&nbsp;of
some item are generally pretty similar, so there is no upper limit on your
earning potential. The down side is that it takes money to make money. Twenty
percent returns on 10 million may not be much but 20% on 5B is real money. There
are a number of great resources on the web (just google) but I will try to run
down the basics of manufacturing, invention, and trading.

&nbsp;<br>

<br><b>Manufacturing<br></b><span><u>The Basics</u><br>Manufacturing is easy to do, but for the T1 market, the
margins are often quiet small. New industrialists are often surprised about the
shear number of goods that are sold below cost. In fact, there is a whole
segment of the EVE economy that is devoted to finding items selling so far
below cost that they can be purchased and refined for a profit! Why does this
happen? People often forget to calculate the true cost of building something.
If you sell a product for less than you can sell the components, then sell the
components. The current meme on the forums for this is MINMAF (minerals I mine
are free). <br><br>Take the following example: <i>you
are walking by a steam and discover a chunk of gold worth $200. Score! You
realize you could turn this gold into a ring worth $100 thinking well, I didn’t
pay anything for the gold so I am up $100. However, reason kicks in and instead
you sell the gold for $200 and buy a $100 ring with $100 still in your pocket;
a much better deal!</i> </span>Don’t be a MINMAF, get your isks worth! Minerals sell at
a brisk rate from SELL orders, just be patient. The unspoken&nbsp;corollary&nbsp;to this is that not all BPOs are profitable. Caveat emptor and make sure you do your research first!<br>

<br>Now there are several caveats and most of them come into
play in complicated settings like PI P4 products, T2 in general, POS
construction, and capitals. These cases happen when the components are
extremely profitable but will not sell by themselves in sufficient volume. In
these cases, it may make sense to take a very small loss in making a final
product that will allow you to move some very profitable components. Many T2
ships are sold with this in mind.

&nbsp;

<br><br><u>Skills</u>

<br>There are a lot of things that are nice but there is only
one that is 100% necessary. You need production efficiency V. Many T1 products
have a profit margin of about 20%. This is exactly the amount you save with PE
level 5. This skill may literally be your profit margin. Other useful skills include mass production/advanced mas production which allow you to run more jobs and supply chain&nbsp;management&nbsp;which lets you manage jobs remotely. Finally,&nbsp;metallurgy and research skills speed up your BPO research.<br><br><u>BPOs</u><br>If you want to go big into manufacturing you need these but
before you run off and start building with&nbsp;them, they will need to be researched. We
have a POS lab which is open to established members and low sec in general
tends to have very short waiting times for lab space. Generally, I will default
to ME20 PE10 but it is really BPO specific. Check out the BPO research
calculator at the end of this section for more details. The other thing you can
do with BPOS is make BPCs. These are just like BPOs but you can only use them a
limited number of times. More over, they are an essential component to
invention.
<i>A Special Note on POS Structure BPOs:</i>

POS and POS related BPOs are not affected by ME. EVE being
EVE of course allows you to research them anyway, but it accomplishes nothing.
On the bright side, they are good to go right off the shelf.
